# hedoragram

my first flutter app ever which is a social app based on instagram ui.

state management: GetX.

MVVM(Model-View-(View)Model) Architecture.

## Getting started
the backend for the app is based on firebase so you need to configure your own settings on firebase console then connect your app to it.

for the flutter app run flutter pub get to install packages, then set const DOMAIN in the file lib/helpers/hhtp_helpers.dart to your local setup.

the app was buit before flutter 2 so it isn't migrated to null safety.
